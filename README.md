# Tic Tac Toe in React.js

## This repository is a game created with the help of the tutorial found at https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe including all the additional tasks mentioned at the end

### Following are the additional features implemented on top of the base tic tac toe game (along with some cleanup and beautification)
- For the current move only, show “You are at move #…” instead of a button.
- Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
- Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw).
- Display the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list.
- Display a seperate game options panel that lets you start a new game, and toggle move list sorting.
