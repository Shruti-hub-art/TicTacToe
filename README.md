# Tic Tac Toe in React.js - Additional tasks implemented

## This repository is a game created with the help of the tutorial found at: https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe

### TODO: Implement all the additional tasks
## For the current move only, show “You are at move #…” instead of a button.
## Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
## Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
## When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the resul
## being a draw).
## Display the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list.
